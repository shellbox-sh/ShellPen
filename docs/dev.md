# üë©‚Äçüíª Developer Docs

`ShellPen` is a basically a collection of mutable `String`s which provides:

 - space or tab indentation tracking and writing
 - a built-in stack for tracking nested object state, e.g. for XML trees
 - persisting BASH object state for in-progress documents

## APIs

The `ShellPen` binary (_and function_) provides three command-line APIs:

 - [`ShellPen [sources|pens|*]`](/api/shellpen) - the public API for end-users
 - [`ShellPen adapter [*]`](/api/adapters) - the public extensions API for adapters
 - [`ShellPen -- [*]`](/api/private) - the private API only be used by `ShellPen`

This documentation focuses on `ShellPen x` for authoring adapters.

## Documentation

The `ShellPen` developer documentation comes in two formats:

 - üéì [Authoring a ShellPen Adapter](/tutorial) tutorial for those who learn by doing
 - üßê [ShellPen Adapter Guide](/adapters) for those who prefer a reference guide

[`ShellPen adapter` API Reference](/api/adapters) has functions signatures (_with examples_)
